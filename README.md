## Cyber Silent Stalker

#### This game was developed as a submission for the 48hr UCI Proto Game Jam, Fall 2018.

My roles within the project include **_designing_** and **_programming_** the gameplay. I also designed, created, and implement the game's aesthetic.

  - Enemy pursuit behaviors.
  - Enemy's stationary behaviors.
